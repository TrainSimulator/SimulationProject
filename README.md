### Simulation project for course

Scripts to run:
- `main.m` runs single simulation (`SimulationF.m`) of the given scenario (`Scenario.m`) and plots station-wise queue length, profit and waiting time distribution
- `mmain.m` runs multiple simulations in parallel and plots distributions of the selected indicators: profit and mean waiting time as well as the mean and variance of the mean waiting time (+ estimates MSE by bootsrapping)
